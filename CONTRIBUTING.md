# Contributing

So, you want to help improve this app? That is fantastic, you are a _wonderful_ person, thank you! Given that I this is a
spare-time project, I can use all the help WE can get.

## Bugs and Feature Requests
1. Report bugs in the [Issues](https://github.com/craftersmine/Noteteka/issues) section. Please explain your bugs as best you can. The best way is to write steps-to-reproduce (STR) which explains step by step how to make the bug happen. Bugs without such a reproduction might not be fixable. If your bug is a crash, please include a logs of your application or stacktraces. 

2. Ask for features in the [Issues](https://github.com/craftersmine/Noteteka/issues) section too. Keep in mind that while WE personally cannot add everything - WE have to constrain ours own workload around features WE will have a use for - perhaps there's another kind person who will be able to add it?  

3. Give _productive_ feedback. Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/craftersmine/Noteteka/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and adhere to it. WE don't owe you anything. Whether you use ours product is completely up to you. Meaning; if you're rude your post will quite simply be ignored.

## Pull Requests
Since WE cannot possibly do everything myself, WE will certainly accept pull requests - but WE must ask that you follow a few ground rules. This is so WE can keep control of the repository, and to help prevent you wasting your time on work that WE will reject.

1. **Remember that many users will be inexperienced both with IDEs and coding**. It's very important that your feature is easy to use.  

2. Please _ask us_ before starting work on a larger contribution. WE have the final say in what WE want added. WE can tell you if what you want to add will be rejected outright and WE really don't want you to waste your time, it's too valuable for me. You can either ask via an [Issue](https://github.com/craftersmine/Noteteka/issues).  

3. WE recommend not trying to do a pull request unless you already have a bit of experience in coding. This isn't any kind of requirement though, if your addition isn't too large you might get some help finishing.  

4. Remember that WE will have to review your work. Anything you can do to help that process will be appreciated.  

5. Expect criticism.  

6. Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/craftersmine/Noteteka/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and adhere to it.
